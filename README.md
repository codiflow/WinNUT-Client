# Future development
WinNUT has gone through a long evolution with several different programming languages and maintainers. The time has come to retire this iteration of WinNUT and begin planning for the next version. See [issue #40](https://github.com/nutdotnet/WinNUT-Client/issues/40) for more information. Join in the discussions at [Coco.Nut](https://github.com/nutdotnet/Coco.Nut), and shape the future of the next iteration of WinNUT.

# Installation
1. Get the [latest Release](https://github.com/nutdotnet/WinNUT-Client/releases)
2. Install WinNUT using the downloaded executable
3. If you were using an older version of WinNUT (v1.x), copy your "ups.ini" configuration file to the WinNUT-Client installation directory (by default "C:\Program Files(x86)\WinNUT-Client ") for an automatic import of your parameters during the first launch
4. Start WinNUT and modify the settings according to your needs

## Synology NAS 
If you are connecting to a Synology NAS with a UPS attached, there is some additional configuration that needs to be done.

Referring to the [Synology documentation](https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/system_hardware_ups?version=7), note that you must add your client computer's IP address to the *Permitted DiskStation Devices* window. In addition, WinNUT requires the following settings:

- **Login**: upsmon
- **Password**: secret
- **UPS Name**: ups


*See [issue 47](https://github.com/gawindx/WinNUT-Client/issues/47#issuecomment-759180793) for more information.*

## QNAP NAS 
If your NUT server is hosted on a QNAP NAS, be sure to provide the following connection information (default):

- **UPS Name**: qnapups
- (Login and Password can be empty)

Also check the "Enable network UPS master" box on the Control Panel -> External device page on the QNAP webinterface and add the IP address of the WinNUT-Client to allow the client to connect to the QNAP for UPS information.
